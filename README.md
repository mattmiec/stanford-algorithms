# stanford-algorithms

These are my solutions to Stanford's Algorithms: Design and Analysis, [Part 1](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/course-v1:Engineering+Algorithms1+SelfPaced/about) (complete!) and [Part 2](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/course-v1:Engineering+Algorithms1+SelfPaced/about) (in progress). I did not find any rules against posting solutions online, please let me know if this is against course policy and I will take this repository down.
